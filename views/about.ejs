    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <section class="general">
        <h3>General</h3>
        <p>This project is an implementation of the Yelp Camp project from Colt Steele's course <a
                href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/" target="_blank">The Web Developer Bootcamp 2024</a>.
            <small>(Note: The title suggests it's updated for 2024, but it's misleading)</small>
        </p>
        <p>While generally following the course, there are a few deviations in this implementation. The main differences
            are
            listed below.</p>
        <p>Deployed in June 2024, it is planned to be maintained until December 2024, with live deployment until June
            2025.

        <h3>Main Differences from the Original Course</h3> <!--TODO-->
        <ul>
            <li>Using MapLibre instead of MapBox to prefer free and open-source options.</li>
            <li>Implementing Nominatim search (forward and reverse) for geo data.</li>
            <li>Feature structure? aggregate $project?</li>
            <li>Seeding data populated with AI help, using a different internal structure from the course.</li>
            <li>Remembering review draft when the user is sent to login.</li>
            <li>Small style differences.</li>

    <section class="evaluation">
        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
        <p>Personal evaluation of various aspects of the project.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Code:</strong>
                <p>The code works and follows Colt's structure, but it's not well-organized, with inconsistencies
                    in style and standards. Future improvements should include refactoring for better readability
                    and maintainability.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong>
                <p>Basic security measures implemented such as Helmet and password hashing. More robust
                    security protocols are recommended.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong>
                <p>The site was not tested or designed to be scalable. It is possible to add more campgrounds
                    or reviews, but the UI will become cluttered, and the lack of a search option will become a notable
                    flaw. Scaling would also require replacing some of the free tools used with paid ones (e.g.,
                    Nominatim's limit on requests, Cloudinary's space limits).</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Extensibility:</strong>
                <p>Adding new features may require extensive modifications to existing components due to the lack
                    of proper encapsulation.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Performance:</strong>
                <p>Uploading images and updating maps can be slow. Actions to minimize lag should be part of
                    future refactoring.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>UI and Style:</strong>
                <p>Basic and primitive, needing more sophisticated design and style.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>User Experience:</strong>
                <p>The site needs significant improvements to enhance UX. Notable flaws include slow performance,
                    lack of search options (other than manual map location or scrolling through campgrounds), and no
                    dark
                    mode.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Responsivity:</strong>
                <p>Planned as mobile-first, the UI works and appears properly on various screen sizes, ranging
                    from mobile to PC.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong>
                <p>The site lacks special accessibility features for disabled users. Supporting screen readers is a
                    must in future refactoring. The site does have simple colors and is forced-dark-mode friendly.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong>
                <p>Efforts are made to maintain transparency in project progress and updates, but detailed logs
                    and documentation are sparse.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Liberty:</strong>
                <p>The project is free and open-source under the WTFPL license, and efforts were made to keep it
                    as FOSS-based as possible. Unfortunately, it relies on Cloudinary, which is a non-free service.
                    Different packages and parts used in it are under their own licenses. Special attention was put to
                    avoid using the non-free MapBox service, replacing it with MapLibre, including <a
                        href="https://github.com/maplibre/demotiles" target="_blank">glyphs</a> that do not require an API key.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Privacy:</strong>
                <p>The site uses cookies for authentication and may use cookies in the future to remember
                    user preferences such as dark/light mode and map background. The project does not collect personal
                    information or metadata and advises users to avoid using real information. The source code is
                    available on GitHub <a href="..." target="_blank">here</a>. However, users should not just trust this declaration
                    and remember that data collection is technically possible from each request. Also, all posts made
                    are visible to everyone. Moreover, the front-end relies on JS scripts in the browser, so it is not
                    friendly for users blocking JS in their browsers.</p>
